Concerns & Thoughts & TODO

1. MVP pattern with adapter

	Basically, I followed the MVP pattern for the architecture, but when it comes with the adapter, there were some confusions.
	I think the adapter should be in View (UI layer) but it can be in Model because it holds country data.
	Since I didn't implement local DB for the country data, just leave it in View for now.

2. Image loading

	For downloading flag image, I decided to use third-party libraries.
	There are amazing third-party libraries for image loading. I chose Glide.
	Glide down-samples the image so OOM (Out of Memory) can be avoided. And it also use Bitmap pool concept to reduce GC.
	It's worth trying.

3. Orientation change

	1) Presenter
		It's important. Presenter should be survived when orientation changes.
		There are few ways to do it. 
		Simple way to do it is making the presenter static reference within activities.
		But I chose to use Loader. I thought it's good to try out and to use Android built-in features to achieve the goal.
	2) Country data (TODO)
		When orientation changes, View asks the presenter to load country data from the web. 
		Local DB should be implemented to avoid reloading data.

4. ConstraintLayout (for better performance)

	There are too many TextViews in Bottom-Sheet information panel. ConstraintLayout can be good for such situation.
	ContraintLayout make a hierarchy flat so it make less measurement and better performance to display.
	It's not something I haven't tried often but I thought worth try it. 

5. Search (TODO)

	I planned to implement search feature. Since it involves creating local DB. It will take more time to it.

6. Resolution (TODO)

	1) Remove hard coded pixels.
	2) Check layouts for multi-screen support
